We have created this clone website by using media queries which makes our project responsive.
Our Main motive of cloning the KOOVS.com was that to create proper functionality and its designing like:
  -Local Storage - which was very helpful to manage lot of data.
  -Async Javascript - which helped us to show slidshow, timers.
  -Hover Effects - styling all the buttons, images etc


CONCLUSION:
Yes we agree that there might be some places where things are static but yes in these 7 days we have done our best and 
completed how much was needed. And one thing I would like to add that teamwork is something which teaches you various things, 
if one stucks like for example in presentation then another comes forward and handle that situation. 
So, this was all from our side and we are delighted to work on similar kind of projects in future as well.
